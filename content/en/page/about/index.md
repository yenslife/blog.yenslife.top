Welcome to my website! This is where I mainly share problems and insights from my learning journey, as well as thoughts on life and some of my projects~

I'm currently a graduate student in Computer Science who loves learning new things. Recently, I've been researching cybersecurity and AI topics. Oh, and I recently wrote a [book](https://llm-book.yenslife.top/), friends interested in Python and LLM can check it out, especially beginners!

Currently, this website is positioned as half technical articles and half personal insights. Why do I write technical articles? Because my memory isn't great, writing articles allows me to review what I've learned anytime, deepens my understanding, and most importantly, I can share it with all friends!
